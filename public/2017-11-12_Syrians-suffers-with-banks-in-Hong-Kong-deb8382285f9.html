I thought maybe I should check with them, so, I went to HSBC office and guess what the same employee said after checking with back-office! “We’re sorry, your application was rejected.” I was like why didn’t you call at least so I would use that time to try other banks, he said: “oh! they didn’t call you, probably they will call you soon”.<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">WOW! you can imagine that a call after that is super not useful to me, right!</strong></p><p name="7071" id="7071" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At first, I took it all in and thought <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Ok! maybe big banks are very strict and avoid troubles.</code> but, no! it was a lot more than just the big ones.</p><p name="2cf0" id="2cf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But, then I got super frustrated, since having a bank account was a need for me where I had to get that to get my salary. <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">I tried a lot of other methods, don&#39;t worry.</code></p><p name="131b" id="131b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And of course, I didn’t want to shout or anything in the banks, because:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="243c" id="243c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">First: the employee at the front has nothing to do with it.</li><li name="88a2" id="88a2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Second: you don’t want to prove to them that they did the right move by not allowing them to facilitate service for this nationality.</li></ul><p name="c171" id="c171" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Yes, I know! me acting on it doesn’t mean that I’m doing it because of I’m Syrian but because I’m disrespected as a human being.</p><p name="ab15" id="ab15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean for god sake, do you think that having a Syrian Passport is a nice joyful ride for us? so you’d come and add this restriction to us like that!<br>I really don’t get it! I mean God gave me the blessing that I was able to leave Syria temporarily during the war that is happening and way luckier than others with such blesses, but that doesn’t mean if I’m disrespected out side my country then it’s ok!<br>I know this isn’t a really positive kind of article, but mans has a limit!</p><p name="cac4" id="cac4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Don’t get me wrong I love Hong Kong, it’s a great place, but I just find it hard to deal with banks.</strong></p><p name="1e96" id="1e96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Peace!</p></div></div></section>
