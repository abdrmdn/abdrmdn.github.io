Why do we love to watch watching sports? Even though we’re not really contributing?
Is it the feeling that I’m right?
Maybe, my team, is…

Even though we’re not really contributing?<br>Is it the feeling that I’m right?<br>Maybe, my team, is superiority makes me feel the same about my self?<br>Is it the need to identify ourselves with the winners?<br>Does watching sport causes the same effect on us as playing sports? triggers hormones ? do we relate? Or is it learning by observing techniques?<br>And why the majority are MEN?</p><h3 name="b17c" id="b17c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">We’re All Just Big Children</h3><p name="07d0" id="07d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You see, watching sports gives us a perfect, safe and secure, black and white, little microcosm of life. Following a player, team or game allows us to experience ups and downs and a whole array of emotions, just like in real life, but we aren’t actually affected.</p><p name="a879" id="a879" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And unlike life, sports and games are generally fair! There are rules and a crystal clear framework, or paradigm that all the participants and spectators know about. There are never any monkey wrenches thrown into a sports game, like the rules changing mid-game for instance. If rules are broken, the offender is penalized. They don’t frustratingly get away sometimes like in real life.</p><p name="e686" id="e686" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Watching sports allows us a temporarily safe and socially acceptable way to be more like our true nature, and our true nature is frighteningly childlike.</p><p name="4785" id="4785" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It&#39;s like watching a horror movie !!<br>They provide a safe way for people to experience high levels of suspension without actually being in any real danger.<br>Sports can be the same way. Again, watching sports allows us to enter a perfect world where the suspenseful outcome has no bearing on our real lives (unless you have a nasty sports gambling problem of course).</p><p name="991a" id="991a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether you want to believe it or not, humans are a lot closer to nature and the animal world than most people like to think.</p><p name="f673" id="f673" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our basic flight or fight mentality is manifested in sports. We can relate, on some deeper and unconscious level, with the guy running with the football towards the end zone and being chased by a pack of angry men. We can understand what it feels like to check another player in hockey and slam him into the boards. Or we can sympathize with the NASCAR driver who gets passed by a competitor but throws it into a higher gear and chases after him.</p><p name="4fbf" id="4fbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our primitive desire for dominance is represented in sports. When our team wins, we experience a sort of dominance over the opposing team and their fans.</p><blockquote name="89e3" id="89e3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">One of the main reasons people like to watch competitions is because they tend to identify themselves with the winners.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="334b" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="e5f3" id="e5f3" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Or is it learning by observing techniques?</strong></p><p name="7603" id="7603" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Plus don’t forget, we were born this way, we watched people walking and we walked, we stared at our parent&#39;s mouths to imitate the movement and we said, mommy!<br>That’s a big part of us that is included in every action we do, we just don’t support it much sometimes! we observe! we learn.</p><p name="a835" id="a835" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">And why the majority are MEN?</strong></p><p name="35dd" id="35dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the 1970s, the script flipped, with the fashionable thinking being that gender differences are artificial constructs. Give little girls footballs or model rockets and little boys baby dolls or princess toys and they’d play perfectly happy with them as long as someone didn’t tell them otherwise.</p><p name="5fa7" id="5fa7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this too was mostly rubbish, as any parent who has raised both a boy and a girl can tell you — and as scientists confirm. The more closely they study brain structure, prenatal hormone exposure and more, the more they confirm that boys and girls are born fundamentally, behaviorally different.</p><p name="0f1c" id="0f1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some say its because we relate to the same gender, since most sports are played by MEN.</p><p name="e370" id="e370" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some say its the same way we relate to the animal world, where female mostly watch the male go hunt or do physical activity is to choose superiors, while the male would be looking and observing their competitors.</p><p name="0547" id="0547" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But what we all know the men mostly tend to not dislike tense physical acts more than women do.</p></div></div></section><section name="8fbb" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="492d" id="492d" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">You may not like sports at all, but we are all quite childlike inside. We all yearn for some level of drama in our lives. And we are all constantly affected by our primitive brain. Watching sports is one excellent way for people to reconcile these inescapable facts.</p><p name="5954" id="5954" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v1mZjJ2Ckc&amp;t=23s" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v1mZjJ2Ckc&amp;t=23s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v1mZjJ2Ckc</a></p><p name="e664" id="e664" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This article is mostly a repost from the great thoughts of ‘Jason OConnor’ <a href="http://www.mentalgamecoaching.com/IMGCAArticles/SportsAndSociety/WhyWeWatchSports.html" data-href="http://www.mentalgamecoaching.com/IMGCAArticles/SportsAndSociety/WhyWeWatchSports.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.mentalgamecoaching.com/IMGCAArticles/SportsAndSociety/WhyWeWatchSports.html</a></p></div></div></section>
