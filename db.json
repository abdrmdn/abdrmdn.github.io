a lot of hows on google for this] and make the code as below:\n    \n    \n    **protected function **gatherData()  \n    {  \n    $data = array_merge($this->factory->getShared(), $this->data);\n    \n    **return **$data;

$value) {  \n**if **($value **instanceof **Renderable) {  \n$data[$key] = $value-&gt;render();  \n}  \n}**return **$data;</code></pre><p>And in my experience, few people use the Views with Renderable passed.</p>\n<p>So what would be awesome is to override Laravel’s functionality [I’m not going to mention how; a lot of hows on google for this] and make the code as below:</p>\n<pre><code>**protected function **gatherData()  \n{  \n$data = array_merge($this-&gt;factory-&gt;getShared(), $this-&gt;data);\n\n**return **$data;  \n}</code></pre><p>After doing this, you’ll notice an increase in performance, which varies based on your server’s speed/page size/so on.</p>\n<p>The increment in our case was about 5–10% [around 20ms] of the server-side load time.</p>\n<p>Views Rendering as mentioned above is something that happens a lot during 1 session call, and the thing is that the pipeline of this <a href=\"https://laravel.com/api/5.3/Illuminate/View/View.html?source=post_page---------------------------#method_render\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Render function</a> is that it works in a recursive way.</p>\n<p>That is normal if you have a page that contains a couple of sections and not a lot of nested views.but, if you use a lot of @includes / @sections , especially the ones inside ForLoops then you’d probably have a big decrement in speed.</p>\n<p>let’s put it this way, if you have 100 products in a page, it will be something like this :</p>\n<pre><code>**@foreach (**$products **as **$key =&gt; $item)**  \n@include(  \n**&apos;productView&apos;,  \n[  \n&apos;product&apos; =&gt; $item,  \n]  \n**)  \n@endforeach**</code></pre><p>and let’s say inside the productView there are 2 other includes. this case will result in 200 render calls when the view is rendered.<br>And after we profiled our application we found that the speed decreases significantly because of this. the solutions to solve this is to either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a standard to avoid more than 2 nested levels to avoid too many rendering.</li>\n<li>Flatten your views and use less includes (which of course is not a nice solution esp. if it’s a platform that is maintained over a long time).</li>\n<li>Use a library that will flatten your views on Production Deployment process (Since I didn’t find a package that does that, so I wrote one <a href=\"https://github.com/Te-cho/compile-blades?source=post_page---------------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Compile-Blades</a>).<br>(Do note that if you have too much of code in your blade it will also create a big decrement in speed, so you have to choose a middle ground).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maybe you know, maybe you don’t that Laravel has a lot of pipelines overhead when it comes to its main feature, so I’d suggest not to use a lot of Middlewares since have pre&amp;post calls to every MiddleWare. I would go for 5 max middleWares as a best practice.</p>\n<p>I will quote what <strong>Ionuț Băjescu</strong> said in an article which was explained better than I’ll ever do : (<a href=\"https://bajescu.com/posts/view/improving-your-laravel-application-performance?source=post_page---------------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>improving Laravel performance</strong></a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Routing is also an expensive task in laravel. To cache the routes.php file run the below command:</p>\n<p><code>_php artisan route:cache_</code></p>\n<p>Mind that it doesn’t work with closures. In case you’re using closures this is a great chance to move them into a controller, as the artisan command will throw an exception when trying to compile routes that are bound to closures instead of proper controller methods.<br>In the same as the config cache, any changes to routes.php will not have any effect anymore. To refresh the cache, run the above command everytime you do a change to the routes file. To completely get rid of the route cache, run the below command:</p>\n<p><code>_php artisan route:clear_</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A couple of other stuff to check, which will improve your website speed significantly are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Config caching</li>\n<li>Classmap optimization</li>\n<li>Optimizing the composer autoload</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those can be also checked out in this <a href=\"https://bajescu.com/posts/view/improving-your-laravel-application-performance?source=post_page---------------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technically detailed article</a>.</p>\n<p>In my experience, if you do all those and u didn’t have them before, you’d gain an improvement of 20–50% in your server page load time.</p>\n<p><strong>Fyi, you should really buy one of those [**</strong>programmers laptop/workstation stickers<strong>]<a href=\"http://tidd.ly/8f345c71?source=post_page---------------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4</a></strong>, they’re amazing 😍.**</p>\n<p><strong>Other Useful Articles:</strong></p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[],"Tag":[]}}
